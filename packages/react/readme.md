# `@blinkdb/react`

This package contains auxiliary methods for smoothly integrating BlinkDB into [React](https://react.dev/).

This package contains benchmarks for BlinkDB against comparable systems as well as low-level benchmarks against `sorted-btree`, the underlying data structure.

To execute all benchmarks, run `npm run start`. A glob that controls which benchmarks are run can be supplied as a parameter. As an example:

- `npm run start` runs all benchmarks in the `./src/benchmarks` directory.
- `npm run start -- "btree/**/*.ts"` runs all benchmarks in the `./src/benchmarks/btree/` directory.
- `npm run start -- "btree/init.ts"` runs the benchmark present in `./src/benchmarks/btree/init.ts`.
