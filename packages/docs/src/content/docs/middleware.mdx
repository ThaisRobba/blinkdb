# Middleware

Sometimes you may want to customize the behaviour of BlinkDB when methods like `insert`, `update`, `remove`, or others are called.
Perhaps you want to prevent all calls to `remove` (and instead soft delete records), or you'd like to log all actions taken, or
you just simply want to intercept all calls to a certain function.

This is all quite simple with a call to [`use()`](/docs/reference/use):

```ts
use(userTable, async (ctx) => {
  // Execute code before calling the implementation
  console.log(ctx.action); // Log the method called
  console.log(ctx.params); // Log parameters given to the method

  // Call the native implementation
  const result = await ctx.next(...ctx.params);

  // Execute code after the implementation
  console.log("Everything worked!");

  // Don't forget to return the result ;)
  return result;
})
```

More info about how hooks work can be found in [the reference](/docs/reference/use).

## Modifying parameters

Hooks allow you to modify parameters passed to BlinkDB functions.

As an example, you can make sure that [`count`](/docs/reference/count) will always [prefer performance to accuracy](/docs/reference/count#performance):

```ts
use(userTable, async (ctx) => {
  if(isAction(ctx, "count")) {
    // Always pass `{ exact: false }` as an option to `count`
    return ctx.next(ctx.params[0], ctx.params[1], { exact: false });
  }
  return ctx.next(...ctx.params);
})
```

## Modifying return values

Just like you can change the objects you pass to `ctx.next()`, you can also modify the return value:

```ts
use(userTable, async (ctx) => {
  if(isAction(ctx, "count")) {
    // `count(...)` will now always return 10 users more than we actually have
    const num = await ctx.next(...ctx.params);
    return num + 10;
  }
  return ctx.next(...ctx.params);
})
```
