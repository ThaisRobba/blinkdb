# Overview

> No matter if you're using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html), or just a simple JS `Map()` in your Frontend -
> These storage methods are not optimized for large-scale data, often buckling under the weight of having to handle
> a couple thousand objects at once. So, **why not bring the queries, indices, convenience and raw speed of databases to the frontend?**

<div class="!my-12 space-y-4">
```ts
// All users called Alice or Charlie
// with an age greater than 24
const items = await many(userTable, {
  where: {
    name: { in: ['Alice', 'Charlie'] },
    age: { gt: 24 }
  },
});
```

<Benchmark
  title={'retrieving all users named "Alice" or "Charlie" for an array of 100.000 items'}
  benchmarks={[
    { name: "blinkDB", time: 0.031 },
    { name: "JS Map()", time: 3.053 },
    { name: "lokijs", time: 4.803 },
  ]} 
/>
</div>

**blinkDB** is a strongly optimized, blazingly fast database just for your frontend. It uses the same
techniques & data structures as existing databases in order to speed up the retrieval of items,
resulting in incredible performance, regardless if you're working with **10.000** or **1.000.000** database entities.
